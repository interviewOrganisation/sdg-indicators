YOUR COUNTRY OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS is responsible for the development and collection of YOUR COUNTRY data for the [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDG) global indicators and for reporting YOUR COUNTRY progress towards them.

This website is for disseminating YOUR COUNTRY SDG indicator data. We are at an Alpha stage in development, so the site is still 'work in progress'.

We initially based YOUR COUNTRY website on the [US SDG reporting platform](https://sdg.data.gov/) and continue to collaborate with the US on further developing our websites. YOUR COUNTRY site has been developed by the [Data Science Campus](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/).  

Other countries wishing to reuse YOUR COUNTRY or US SDG reporting platforms are welcome to do so for free. Our [Guidance page](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/guidance/) highlights key information on how to do this, linking to detailed technical instructions available in our [wiki pages](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-indicators/wiki). The US have also produced various [training materials](https://sdg.data.gov/training/). The  [Center for Open Data Enterprise (CODE)](http://www.opendataenterprise.org/) can also provide guidance and support through their [SDG National Reporting Initiative](https://www.sdgreporting.org/).

If you have any feedback on this website or YOUR COUNTRY SDG data then please contact us at <a href="mailto:{{site.email_contacts.questions}}">{{site.email_contacts.questions}}</a>. The answers to some frequently asked questions are also available in our [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/faq.md %}).
